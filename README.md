A simple CPU-based rasterizer written in Rust.

This project renders a framebuffer to the screen using [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/minifb) and is inspired by [Sebastian Lague’s software rasterizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyJ-hdISgnw).
The goal of this project is to learn how [rasterization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation) works internally while exploring the Rust Programming Language.

Features:
CPU rasterization (no GPU APIs)
Real-time display using minifb

*This is a learning project and not intended to be a full-featured renderer.*
