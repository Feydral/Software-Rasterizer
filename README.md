A simple CPU-based rasterizer written in Rust.

This project renders a framebuffer to the screen using [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/minifb) and is inspired by [Sebastian Lague’s software rasterizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyJ-hdISgnw).
The goal of this project is to learn how [rasterization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation) works internally while exploring the Rust Programming Language.

## Features
- CPU-based rasterization
- Real-time display using minifb

## Notes
This is a learning project and is not intended to be a full-featured renderer.

## Controls
- **WASD**: move
- **Arrow keys**: look around
- **Shift / Space**: move down / up

## Credits
Big thanks to **RobGPT/Gangrob** for the help!
